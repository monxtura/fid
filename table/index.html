            The first edition of 900 copies was released on the band's original label Leathür Records. Elektra Records 
            signed the band the following year, at which point the album was remixed and partially re-recorded. This 
            re-release, with a different track listing and slightly different artwork, has become the standard version 
            from which all later reissues derive. While the album only reached number 77 on the Billboard 200 album chart 
            in the United States, it would ultimately reach platinum status.</td>

        <td colspan="2">In Utero is the third and final studio album by the American rock band Nirvana, 
            released on September 21, 1993, by DGC Records. After breaking into the mainstream with their 
            second album, Nevermind (1991), Nirvana hired Steve Albini to record In Utero, seeking a more 
            complex, abrasive sound that was reminiscent of their work before Nevermind. Although frontman 
            and primary songwriter Kurt Cobain claimed that the album was "very impersonal", many of its songs 
            contain heavy allusions to his personal life and struggles, expressing feelings of angst that were 
            common on the band's previous album. Critics praised the album’s raw, unconventional sound and Cobain's 
            lyricism. The album is certified 5× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 
            the US and has sold 15 million copies worldwide. It was the final Nirvana album before Cobain's suicide in 1994. </td>

            founding member Pete Willis, Pyromania was produced by Robert John "Mutt" Lange. Pyromania

        <td colspan="2">The Wall is the eleventh studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 30 November 1979 
            by Harvest/EMI and Columbia/CBS Records. It is a rock opera about Pink, a jaded rock star who constructs a psychological
             "wall" of social isolation. The album was a commercial success, topping the US charts for 15 weeks and reaching number 
             three in the UK. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom found it overblown and pretentious, but 
             later received accolades as one of the greatest albums of all time. The Wall was the last album to feature Pink Floyd as 
             a quartet; the keyboardist, Richard Wright, was fired by Waters during production but stayed on as a salaried musician. 
             The Wall is one of the best-known concept albums. With over 30 million copies sold, it is the second best-selling album 
             in the band's catalog (behind 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon), the best-selling double-album of all time, and one of the
              best-selling albums of all time overall. In 2000, it was voted number 30 in Colin Larkin's All-Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2003, 
              2012, and 2020, it was included in Rolling Stone's lists of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". </td>

            greatest and most influential heavy metal albums of all time, often cited as a key influence for the development of the genre 
            as well as one of its earliest albums. Paranoid was ranked number one on Rolling Stone‘s list of the "100 Greatest Metal Albums

            It was released on November 15, 1986, by Def Jam and Columbia Records. The album became the first 
            rap LP to top the Billboard album chart and was the second rap album to become a platinum album. It 
            is one of Columbia Records' fastest-selling debut records to date and was certified Diamond by the 
            Recording Industry Association of America in 2015 for shipping over ten million copies in the United States. 
            The album received critical acclaim for its unique musical style, the chemistry between the group members, 
            and their stylized rapping. Since its release, Licensed to Ill has been ranked by critics as one of the greatest 
            hip-hop and debut albums of all time.</td>
